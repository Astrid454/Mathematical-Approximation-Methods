##  Technologies

- **Java**  
- **MATLAB** used for initial testing and algorithm exploration

---

##  Description

This project includes implementations of classic numerical methods such as:

- Trapezoidal Rule
- Midpoint Rule
- Simpson’s Rule
- Gaussian Elimination (with Partial Pivoting)
- Back Substitution

These methods are designed to approximate definite integrals or solve linear systems.

##  How It Works

1. Numerical integration methods calculate the approximate integral of a function over an interval using different rules (trapezoidal, midpoint, Simpson).
2. Gaussian Elimination and Back Substitution are used to solve systems of linear equations by transforming the augmented matrix and computing solutions.
